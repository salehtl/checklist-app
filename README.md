## Routing & Data Fetching

This template now includes [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router) and
[TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query). The router configuration lives in
`src/router.tsx` and is mounted together with a `QueryClient` in
`src/frontend.tsx`.

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.17. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
